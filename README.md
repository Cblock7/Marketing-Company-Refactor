# MarketingCompanyRefactor

# In this assignment I fixed the semantics of the html and css files to be more descriptive. I swapped out many generic div elements for things like headers, sections, nav, and footers. I also cleaned up the line structure to be easier to read. 

#Fixed an issue causing one of the links in the nav bar to not work properly.
